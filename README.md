Rubyweaver
==========

Ruby syntax highlighting for Dreamweaver. I created this back in 2005/2006 
so I could write Ruby/Rails code in Dreamweaver and get some syntax highlighting.

It's been so long since I've used Dreamweaver that I have no idea how to actually
install it anymore, but people are still using it so I'm providing the code here.
If someone knows how to install it please issue me a pull request with updates
to this README explaining how. Thanks!
